# fuzzer

A programming project for classes at my university. Still under development. Some functions don't meet my expectations and will be modified.

In order to use: download executable or build it with code, input path to .exe file you want to test, input path to example .jpg file that chosen .exe can process, choose the number of iterations and other stuff.
Then run
